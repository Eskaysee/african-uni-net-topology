to clear the country directories of pictures and csv table enter "make clean" in terminal
"make graphs" generates the graph from the data in the json results files under each university directory inside its country folder
if the json are lost they can be regenerated by typing "make results" into the terminal provided "measurement.txt" in the main folder. This contains a dictionary of existing measurements. (the ones used in the resport). This would be needed before generating the graphs if the json is not already present.
